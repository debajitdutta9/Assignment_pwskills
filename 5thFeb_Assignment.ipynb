    "1.Abstraction: It is the process of hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary information to   the user.\n",

It is a reference to the instance on which a method is being invoked and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class. The use of self allows each object to have its own copy of the instance variables, and ensures that the method is operating on the correct instance of the class."
