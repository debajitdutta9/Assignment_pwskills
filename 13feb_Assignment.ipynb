    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.       \n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The Exception class is used as the base class for custom exceptions because it is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. By inheriting from the Exception class, custom exceptions become part of the standard exception hierarchy in Python and can be caught and handled using the same mechanism as built-in exceptions. This allows custom exceptions to be integrated seamlessly into existing exception handling mechanisms in a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from the Exception class also allows custom exceptions to be easily subclassed to create more specific exceptions. For example, you can create a custom exception class for a specific type of error in your application and then create subclasses for specific error cases. This makes it easy to create a hierarchical structure of exceptions that can be used to handle different types of errors in a structured and meaningful way."

    "\n",
    "2.Avoid catching general exceptions: Avoid catching general exceptions like 'Exception', 'BaseException', etc. as they catch everything, including the ones you don't want to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use try-except-else-finally block: Use the try-except-else-finally block for more robust exception handling. The try-except block handles the exception, the else block handles the normal flow, and the finally block releases any acquired resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Handle exceptions as close to the source as possible: This makes it easier to debug and understand what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Use logging: Use the logging module to log the exceptions, along with the context information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Don't ignore exceptions: Ignoring exceptions is a bad practice. It hides the problems, making it difficult to diagnose and fix the root cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Keep exception messages simple and clear: Keep the exception messages simple and clear, so that other developers can quickly understand the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Raise exceptions when needed: Raise exceptions only when needed. Don't raise exceptions for normal flow control."
