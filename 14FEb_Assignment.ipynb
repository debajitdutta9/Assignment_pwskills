    "Q1 What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the execution of multiple threads in a single program. Each thread is an independent flow of execution, with its own call stack and state. Threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, thereby increasing the overall performance and responsiveness of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are used to handle I/O bound and network-bound tasks, where the waiting time for the results is much longer than the time required for computation. Using threads, a program can perform other tasks while waiting for the I/O or network response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a way to create and manipulate threads in a Python program. The threading module also provides synchronization primitives like locks, events, and semaphores to manage access to shared resources between threads."

    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock and race condition are two common problems that can occur in a multithreaded environment:\n",
    "\n",
    " Deadlock  : A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource, which it holds. In other words, a set of processes are blocked and none of them can continue until one or more of the other processes completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition: A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. As a result, the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switching of the processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can cause program crashes or other serious errors in multithreaded programs. They can be difficult to detect and fix, and can often be avoided through careful design and synchronization of shared resources in the program.\n",
